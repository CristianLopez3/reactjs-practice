# React + Vite + React - Router

Aspects important if in the future I need :

* useNavigate()
* useState()
* useEffect()
* HashRouter
* Nesting Routes.
* localStorage

## Local Storage :book:
local storage basic functions:

```JSX
localStorage.setItem(name, value);
localStorage.getItem(name, value);
```

In the localStorage values you can add arrays and simple variables
